# Simple TLS Example

## Overview
Simple yet functional TLS-secured server-client communication via sockets implemented in C++ using OpenSSL. 

## Dependencies
This project requires a C++ compiler (such as GCC), the Make utility, and OpenSSL. On Debian-based systems, the necessary tools can be installed with the following command:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev
```

## Run
To compile the client and the server a 'Makefile' was added.
